This style replaced the earlier stiff, constricting boned bodice-and-skirt style previously worn by women. As the style evolved, the pleats at the front were reduced in number and the bodice was opened, with the torso now covered by a stiffened piece of fabric known as a stomacher. Originally an informal style, the mantua gradually developed as formal dress and the skirt grew to extraordinary proportions. The mantua was thought to display silk designs to their best advantage, as they were draped rather than cut; as such, it is believed the garment was named after Mantua, Italy, where expensive silks were produced.

CC00306,rubber,"A natural hydrocarbon polymer formed from the resinous latex of trees of the Hevea and Parthenium genera. To prepare natural rubber, the latex is collected from a cut in the bark, precipitated with acid, then washed and dried. Rubber is very elastic and was used for bowls, shoe soles, adhesives, and bouncy balls. However, when cooled, rubber becomes brittle and when warmed it becomes sweaty and tacky. Prior to the development of synthetic resins, unvulcanized rubber was used for adhesive tapes and crepe shoe soles. In 1839, Charles Goodyear discovered that rubber can be hardened with the vulcanization process in which sulfur is used to initiate crosslinking of the hydrocarbon strands. Higher sulfur content produces a harder, denser material. Vulcanized rubber is used to make rubber bands, foams, fabric coatings, small objects, combs, pens, and musical instruments. Vulcanized rubber, however, will emit sulfur when exposed to light or heat causing the rubber to degrade and become brittle. Since the 19th century, small amounts of wax have been added to the rubber during vulcanization. The wax slowly migrates to the surface and provides a thin layer of protection from oxidation.",The J.

CC00309,starch,"Substance made of carbohydrate granules of varying sizes obtained from roots, bulbs, and seeds of most plants. Starch is primarily obtained from rice, wheat, corn, potatoes, cassava (tapioca), sago, and arrowroot. It is a mixture of the soluble straight-chain amylose molecules and the insoluble, branched-chain amylopectin molecules. When starch is heated, the granules swell and form a thick, tacky jelly upon cooling. Starchy adhesives have been used since at least 3500 BCE in Egypt. More recently starch has been used for sizing fabric, canvas, and paper, as an adhesive for paper cartons, bottle labels, gummed tape, and envelopes. Soluble starch has been used for priming canvas and as a binder in watercolor paints. Starch is sensitive to moisture and biodegradation. Starchy paste films become brittle with age.",The J.
